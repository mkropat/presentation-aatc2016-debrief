        <p>“organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations”</p>

        <h2 class="bullet">The Idea</h2>
        <h3 class="bullet">Coarse-grained communication between teams leads to coarse-grained APIs between teams</h3>
        <p class="bullet">Teams that are under different org structures</p>
        <p class="bullet">Teams that are physical separate</p>
        <h3 class="bullet">Fine-grained communication between people leads to fine-grained (RPC-style) APIs</h3>
        <p class="bullet">Teams that sit next to each other</p>
        <p class="bullet">Or a single team that owns many different microservices</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3 class="bullet">RPC-style APIs between teams</h3>
        <p class="bullet">Specific API contracts outlining specific request payloads and responses</p>
        <p class="bullet">Tends to require coordinated releases</p>
        <p class="bullet">Fan-in for end-to-end testing</p>
        <p class="bullet">Easy to abuse responsibilities of different services</p>
        <p class="bullet">Can lead to worst of both worlds...<br/>a distributed monolith</p>
